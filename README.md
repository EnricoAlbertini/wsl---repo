# wsl---repo
Repo created to keep track of ALL changes made in my WSL FILESYSTEM. It has 2 functions: 1) Keep track of the evolution of my manuals, code, projects, course examples and exercises 2) Keep track of the changes(some of which are undercover and unintuitive) made in wsl system settings and miscellaneous.
